# Front End Assignment - Car List

## Install

git clone
```

Navigate to the folder where you cloned the files to and run 
```
npm install
npm start
```
Then run tests with 
```
npm test
```

## Tools

I did the setup of the app with the bootstrap tool "create-react-app" to set up the project quickly. 

And because of that I got some things in that package, such as Jest for testing.

Apart from what you got with that package I have only added the required "Redux" package for state management.
