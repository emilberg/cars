# Front End Assignment - Car List

## Install
```
git clone https://github.com/emilberg/cars
```

Navigate to the folder where you cloned the files to and run 
```
npm install
npm start
```
Run tests  
```
npm test
```

## Tools

I did the setup of the app with the "bootstrap" tool "create-react-app" to set up the project quickly. 

And because of that I got some things in that package, such as Jest for testing. 

Apart from what you get with the "bootstrap" package I have also added: 

* *redux*, *react-redux* for state management 
* *enzyme*, *enzyme-adapter-react-16* for testing
